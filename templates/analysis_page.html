    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>The stock prediction model utilizes a neural network with a core structure designed for efficient learning from historical stock price data.
        The model features a primary layer with 128 neurons to capture complex patterns and a linear output layer sized to predict future stock prices over a designated horizon.
        The model is trained on historical stock price data for last 3 years of 25 stocks from different sectors, ensuring a diverse and robust learning experience.</p>
        <hr>
    <p>For enhanced accuracy with recent market trends, users have the option to "retrain" the model.
        This process involves adapting the original model by appending a new trainable layer while keeping previous layers fixed, allowing the model to fine-tune predictions
        based on the latest data without losing previously learned information.</p>
        <hr>
    <p>The model is optimized with an adaptive learning rate to ensure quick and effective training,
        using Mean Absolute Error as the metric for performance evaluation.</p>
